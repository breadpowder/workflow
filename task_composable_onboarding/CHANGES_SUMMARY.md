# Task Planning Updates - Summary of Changes

**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Updated By**: Claude Code
**Reason**: Gap analysis findings - align implementation with P0 requirements

## Executive Summary

All planning documents under `task_composable_onboarding/` have been updated to address the following critical gaps:

1. ✅ **Stage Support** - Added stage-based workflow progression
2. ✅ **Full Component Implementation** - DocumentUpload and ReviewSummary fully implemented (not placeholders)
3. ✅ **localStorage Persistence** - State persistence for better demo experience
4. ✅ **API Endpoint Alignment** - Updated specs to match implementation
5. ✅ **Enhanced Error Messages** - YAML validation with file:line context
6. ✅ **Acceptance Test Automation** - Mapped requirements to integration tests

**Time Impact**: Increased from 18-20 hours to 22-24 hours (+4-5 hours)

## Implementation Impact

### New TypeScript Interfaces

```typescript
// Stage Support
interface WorkflowStage {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  order: number;
}

interface WorkflowStep {
  // ... existing fields
  stage?: string;  // NEW
}

interface RuntimeMachine {
  // ... existing fields
  stages: WorkflowStage[];        // NEW
  stepsByStage: Record<string, string[]>;  // NEW
}

// localStorage Support
interface SavedState {
  currentStepId: string;
  collectedInputs: Record<string, any>;
}
```

### New Functions

```typescript
// Stage Functions
function getStageProgress(stage, machine, inputs): StageProgress
function getCurrentStage(currentStepId, machine): WorkflowStage | null
function buildStageIndex(steps, stages): Record<string, string[]>

// localStorage Functions
function saveStateToStorage(clientId, state): void
function loadStateFromStorage(clientId): SavedState | null
function clearStateFromStorage(clientId): void
```

### New UI Components

1. **components/layout/stage-timeline.tsx**
   - Visual stage progression
   - Current stage highlight
   - Completion indicators

2. **components/ui/generic-document-upload.tsx** (FULL)
   - File picker + drag-and-drop
   - Validation (type, size)
   - Base64 storage
   - Preview/delete

3. **components/ui/review-summary.tsx** (FULL)
   - Table format
   - Grouped by stage
   - Edit links
   - Status indicators

  - Three component types test
  - Conditional branching test
  - Stage progression test
  - localStorage persistence test
```

### Updated Test Coverage

- ReviewSummary display
- End-to-end with persistence

---

## YAML Schema Changes

### Before
```yaml
steps:
  - id: collectContactInfo
    task_ref: contact_info/corporate
    next:
      default: collectDocuments
```

### After
```yaml
stages:
  - id: client_information
    name: "Client Information"
    order: 1

steps:
  - id: collectContactInfo
    stage: client_information    # NEW
    task_ref: contact_info/corporate
    next:
      default: collectDocuments
```

---

## API Changes

### Before
```
GET /api/workflows?client_type=...&jurisdiction=...
```

### After
```
GET /composable_onboardings
GET /composable_onboardings/compiled?client_type=...&jurisdiction=...
GET /clients/{id}/state
POST /clients/{id}/state
```

---

## Component Implementation Changes

### Before
```typescript
const UI_COMPONENT_REGISTRY = {
  'form': GenericFormWrapper,
  'document-upload': DocumentUploadWrapper,  // Placeholder
  'review-summary': ReviewSummaryWrapper,    // Placeholder
};
```

### After
```typescript
const UI_COMPONENT_REGISTRY = {
  'form': GenericFormWrapper,                // Fully implemented
  'document-upload': GenericDocumentUploadWrapper,  // FULLY IMPLEMENTED
  'review-summary': ReviewSummaryWrapper,           // FULLY IMPLEMENTED
};
```

---

## Production Readiness Notes

### POC Limitations (Documented)
- localStorage for state (not database)
- Base64 file storage (not blob storage)
- Client-side state only (no server persistence)

### Production Migration Path
- Replace localStorage with REST API `/clients/{id}/state`
- Implement database backend (PostgreSQL/MongoDB)
- Add blob storage for documents (S3/Azure Blob)
- Add multi-user concurrency support
- Implement optimistic locking

---

## Success Criteria Updates

All P0 requirements now addressed:

✅ YAML-driven workflows editable by admins
✅ Deterministic progression with required-field gating
✅ At least two distinct UI components via registry (form + document-upload + review-summary)
✅ Stage-based progression with UI display
✅ localStorage persistence for demo
✅ Self-hosted CopilotKit runtime
✅ Acceptance tests mapped and automated

---

## Next Steps

1. Review updated planning documents
2. Confirm alignment with business requirements
3. Begin implementation starting with Task 1
4. Follow updated time estimates (22-24 hours)
5. Validate all acceptance criteria during implementation
